# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, 
- We ovresample the data using the 
    - RandomOverSampler
    - SMOTE algorithms
- Undersample the data using the 
    - ClusterCentroids algorithm
- Used combinatorial approch of over and undersam;oing using th SMOTEENN algorithm.
By using all the above models we can make recommendation whether they should use predict credit risk
